# Deploying FortiGate Autoscale Templates in AWS (build: 11)

## Welcome!

AWS Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is elastic, complex, and quite different from traditional on-premise networking. In this workshop you will learn how to deploy FortiGate Firewalls in an elastic autoscale group to protect your AWS workloads deployed in common architecture patterns.

This workshop is intended to help accomplish the following:

  * Learn common AWS networking concepts such as routing traffic in and out of VPCs for various traffic flows
  * Use AWS Cloudshell and Terraform to deploy a Fortigate autoscale group in a usable demo environment
  * Interact with a FortiGate autoscale group build security policy sets, and deploy them
  * Test traffic flows in an example environment and use a FortiGate autoscale group to control traffic flows
  * Deploy a FortiGate autoscale group into an existing customer environment.
