## Accessing an AWS environment

For the FortiGate Autoscale Tec Recipe, you will need the following:

  * **AWS sign in link**
  * **IAM User w/ console access**
  * **Password for the IAM User**
  * **Two properly sized ITF'd BYOL licenses for Fortigate VM (recommend unlimited CPUs to avoid sizing confusion)**


## Navigating the AWS Console

When you first login you will see the Console Home page.

Use the **Search Box** at the top to search for services such as EC2, VPC, Cloud Shell, etc.

When the results pop up, **right click** the name of the service and open the desired console in a new tab. This makes navigation easier.
